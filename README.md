# ðŸ¦· Dental X-ray Instance Segmentation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my graduation project, focusing on leveraging deep learning to assist dentists in detecting and segmenting dental structures from X-ray images with precision.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Details
- Trained on a dental X-ray dataset hosted on **Roboflow**.
- Designed to identify and segment teeth and related dental structures.
- My role: Developing and training the YOLOv11 instance segmentation model.

## ðŸ’» What I Worked On
- Used a pre-prepared dataset for training and testing.
- Applied preprocessing & augmentation for better generalization.
- Developed and trained a **YOLOv11 instance segmentation** model to identify and segment dental structures in X-ray images.
- Evaluated performance on unseen data to ensure robustness.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- YOLOv11
- Python
- Roboflow

## ðŸ“Š Results
| Metric        | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Box Precision | 0.879 |
| Box Recall    | 0.813 |
| mAP50 (Boxes) | 0.874 |
| mAP50-95 (Boxes) | 0.617 |
